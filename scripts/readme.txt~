A brief description of the scripts used will be given:

upddb.pl: runs in a crontab to update the weblvnapp_lvn_entry table in db. This is the main table 
kept in db. The usage is: './uppdb.pl' to run it from current directory. First of all it copies all rev_db files from vevak into rev_db directory. Based on the branches selected to be displayed converts each rev_db txt dile into a csv file and then scans through the entries to find those that are not present in db. It does not scan backwards only adds entries after the last present. 

filldb.pl: This is a script that fills above mentioned table (provided that LVN Affecting Table wiki entries hav been converted 
from .html to csv). It was used once to initially fill the table and never before. Table is kept insync by upddb.pl script.

fillwikidb.pl: The second important script to fill the weblvnapp_wiki_entry table in db. Due to a problem  (LVN Affecting Table entries do not have a key and they are not unique) each time the whole table is cleared and the csv input (LVN affecting table html page is converted to csv by a script whenever there is a need to do that) is imported into the table. When LVN Affecting Table wiki will cease to be used there will no need to run this script.

fillBranchesdb.pl: It is used to fill the weblvnapp_branch table when ther is a new branch to be displayed.

printallWiki.pl: Will be used to print in a file (currently LVN_<branch>.html) all entries from Wiki_entry table for a specific branch. To be used with real.sh script to send email to those that have forgotten to put entry in Wiki_entry table.

printWiki_rev1_2_rev2.pl: Used to print in a txt file (report.txt) all entries from rev1 (in branch A) to rev2 (in branch B).
